<p>Regular night shows run 10PM-2AM and are 21+.<br/>
Matinee shows are seasonal and generally run 6-9PM on Fridays and 5-8PM on Sundays.</p>
<p>Matinees are usually family-friendly, but each guest under 21 years of age MUST be accompanied by an adult guardian, unless a show is specifically advertised as “All-Ages”. The Replay is strictly 21+ after 9PM.</p>
<p>Matinee shows are hosted on our patio stage in the warmer months. Outdoor shows must stay below a certain decibel level due to city noise ordinances, so not every act is well-suited for our patio. Generally, acoustic-based music works best. All live music outdoors must end by 9PM.</p>
<p>We have a Modern Pro Audio System, suitable for Live Bands, DJs and Electronic acts, and Acoustic acts of all levels.<br/>
Our indoor stage is approximately 12 foot ×12 foot. Our outdoor stage is approximately 12 foot × 15 foot.</p>
